## Short bio
Currently ending my education at [Polytech Sorbonne](https://www.polytech.sorbonne-universite.fr/formations/mathematiques-appliques-et-informatique) in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, I'm willing to continue my studies with a PhD. I'm currently working at the [Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble](https://www.liglab.fr/). You can have a look at my [projects]({{ base_path }}/projects/) and [CV]({{ base_path }}/cv/).

### Potentially interesting qualities
* I like complex and multi-field problems
* I tend to criticize the meaning and the usefulness of my activity
* I'm not afraid of proposing absurd ideas and questions

## Research interests
* Machine Learning, theoretical aspects
* Ecology, Environmental studies
* Graphical Models, Inference, Causality
* Combinatorial Optimisation, Graph Theory
* Topological Approaches in Data Analysis


<!-- ## Ideal Internship
I listed here the criteria I find the most important for my final internship. It should last 6 months and begin as soon as possible.

### Field
* Machine Learning, theoretical aspects
* Conductive to interesting metaphysical thoughts: Causality, Information, Learning, etc.
* Possible applications in ecological and environmental studies

### Context and objectives
* To have a clear conduct line and objective
* To be free to explore and criticize the objective
* Theoretical aspects and interpretations at the core of the objective
* Some application and implementation part, with some algorithmic challenges, and minimum coding and high performance computing details

### Lab
 Une ville agréable et riche à découvrir, Toulouse, Lyon, Nancy, Grenoble
* Laboratoire accessible en vélo
* Travail en présentiel, avec quelque flexibilité
* Being able to interact with several researchers, to discover, to go to conferences

### Divers
* Éviter d'être financé par des organisations louches (industries d'armement, finance, acquisition de données personelles, etc.) -->

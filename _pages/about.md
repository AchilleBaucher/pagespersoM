## What
I'm administratively considered as a PhD tutored by Romain Couillet in the POLARIS team of the *Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble*. 

The report of my internship in french is [here]({{ base_path }}/files/rapport_lig.pdf), and the slides of my presentation [there]({{ base_path }}/files/diapos_lig.pdf). There is also the [article]({{ base_path }}/files/gretsiw3.pdf) I submitted to GRETSI 2022.

## Short bio
Currently ending my education at [Polytech Sorbonne](https://www.polytech.sorbonne-universite.fr/formations/mathematiques-appliques-et-informatique) in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, I'm working at the [Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble](https://www.liglab.fr/). You can have a look at my [projects]({{ base_path }}/projects/).

The report of my internship in french is [here]({{ base_path }}/files/rapport_lig.pdf), and the slides of my presentation [there]({{ base_path }}/files/diapos_lig.pdf). There is also the [article]({{ base_path }}/files/gretsiw3.pdf) I submitted to GRETSI 2022.

## LIG internship, since the 1/10/2021
I'm simultaneously working on this 2 objectives:
### Machine learning of system dynamics
* Objective: From given dynamic data, try to learn causal relations, interconnections, functions that link variables.
* Means: Train an Echo State Network (ESN) to predict the next sequence of this varaibles. Then analyse within the neurone reservoir inside the network, what type of dynamics, relations and paramters have been learnt.
* Currently: 12/10, I try to understand how does an ESN work

### Understanding ecological models and teaching applications
* Objective: Use models like Wolrd3, HANDY or Structural Deomgraphic Theory to help us understanding out world's dynamics and deduce adapted solutions in front of the ecological crisis
* Means: Simple implementations of these models for teaching applications
* Currently: 12/10, I try to implement the 12 meadows's senarios on pyworld3

### Final objective
It would be to gather the two objectives by automatically learning system dynamics of models like World3 etc.

### Ending 07/03
My report in french is [here]({{ base_path }}/files/rapport_lig.pdf), and the slides of my presentation [there]({{ base_path }}/files/diapos_lig.pdf).


### Potentially interesting qualities
* I like complex and multi-field problems
* I tend to criticize the meaning and the usefulness of my activity
* I'm not afraid of proposing absurd ideas and questions

## Research interests
* Machine Learning, theoretical aspects
* Ecology, Environmental studies
* Graphical Models, Inference, Causality
* Combinatorial Optimisation, Graph Theory
* Topological Approaches in Data Analysis


## Ideal Internship
I listed here the criteria I find the most important for my final internship. It should last 6 months and begin as soon as possible.

### Field
* Machine Learning, theoretical aspects
* Conductive to interesting metaphysical thoughts: Causality, Information, Learning, etc.
* Possible applications in ecological and environmental studies

### Context and objectives
* To have a clear conduct line and objective
* To be free to explore and criticize the objective
* Theoretical aspects and interpretations at the core of the objective
* Some application and implementation part, with some algorithmic challenges, and minimum coding and high performance computing details

### Lab
 Une ville agréable et riche à découvrir, Toulouse, Lyon, Nancy, Grenoble
* Laboratoire accessible en vélo
* Travail en présentiel, avec quelque flexibilité
* Being able to interact with several researchers, to discover, to go to conferences

### Divers
* Éviter d'être financé par des organisations louches (industries d'armement, finance, acquisition de données personelles, etc.) -->

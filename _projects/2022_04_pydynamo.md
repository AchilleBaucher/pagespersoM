I precisely explain what I've done and thought about during my internship in my [internship report]({{ base_path }}/files/rapport_lig.pdf). I also present the World3 model and the interpretation of my experiments in the [article]({{ base_path }}/files/gretsiw3.pdf) I've submitted to GRETSI 2022. The practical session (in french) and the pydynamo code are available on [my git](https://gitlab.inria.fr/abaucher/pydynamo).
